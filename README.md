## Lecture Notes

### Riccardo A. Cioffi

These lecture notes were written as part of the teaching material for a PhD class taught at the Paris School of Economics.
The material _heavily_ borrows from a class taught by Benjamin Moll while I was a student at Princeton, as well as from other classes taught there, most notably by Gianluca Violante and Jonathan Payne.
I also received a lot of help from one of my students, Leonardo Endrizzi, as well as other students who provided very useful feedback.
While these notes would not have been possible without them, it goes without saying that all errors are exclusively mine.
    
If you find error, typos, or would simply like to discuss the material in these notes please write me an email at riccardo.cioffi@psemail.eu (or alternatively, simply open an issue here in this repo).
